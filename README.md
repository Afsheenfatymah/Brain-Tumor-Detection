# Brain-Tumor-Detection 🧠
 

# Overview
I’m excited to share my latest project that leverages Teachable Machine by Google to classify brain images into two categories: 

healthy brain and brain tumor. 

This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in the medical field, particularly in early detection and diagnosis of brain conditions.

# Features
* Image Classification: Differentiates between healthy brain images and those indicating the presence of a brain tumor. 🩺

* Teachable Machine Integration: Utilizes Google’s Teachable Machine to train a custom model. 🔬

* Medical Relevance: Aims to assist in the preliminary screening of brain health, supporting healthcare professionals in diagnostic processes. ⚕️

# Data Source: The data for this project was sourced from Kaggle, providing a rich and diverse dataset for training. 📊

# How to Use
Clone the Repository 📁:
https://github.com/Afsheenfatymah/Brain-Tumor-Detection.git

Teachable Machine URL https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/models/rdMkHpLFn/

# Setup 🔧:
Ensure you have Teachable Machine access.
Download the pre-trained model from the repository or train your own using Teachable Machine.

# Run the Model 🔍:
* Follow the instructions in the README.md file to load and use the model.
* Upload brain images for classification to determine if they are healthy or show signs of a tumor.

# Medical Impact
Early and accurate detection of brain tumors can significantly impact patient outcomes. This model can serve as a preliminary screening tool, aiding in the early identification of potential issues and allowing for timely medical intervention. 💡
